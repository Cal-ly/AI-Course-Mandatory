## **Analysis: Startup Profit Prediction (with OneHotEncoder)**

### **Dataset Information:**
- **Total dataset:** 50 instances
- **Training/Test Split:** 40 training instances, 10 test instances.

### **Sample Predictions Analysis:**

| Predicted Profit | Actual Profit | Percentage Error (%) |
|------------------|---------------|----------------------|
| 126,703.03       | 134,307.35    | **5.92%**             |
| 84,894.75        | 81,005.76     | **4.80%**            |
| 99,893.42        | 99,937.59     | **0.26%**            |
| 46,501.71        | 64,926.08     | **28.38%**  *(Large deviation)* |
| 128,750.48       | 125,370.37    | **2.70%**  |

- **Average Percentage Error:** **8.58%**, moderate overall; one instance significantly off (fourth prediction), indicating possible outliers or unmodeled variables.
- **Sample RMSE:** ~9,299.25 (indicating moderate prediction accuracy).

### **Overall Model Performance:**

- **Final Test RMSE:** **9,055.96**
  - Indicates moderate predictive performance. The suitablility for advisory purposes given financial predictions, is up to the advisor i.e. *meh*

### **Cross-validation Performance:**

- **Cross-validation RMSE scores:** `[8,084.51, 10,538.04, 8,900.70, 8,052.16, 16,232.83]`
- **Average CV RMSE:** **10,361.65**
- **Standard deviation:** **3,071.00** *(indicating noticeable variability across folds)*

> High RMSE in one fold (`16,232.83`) suggests some subsets are significantly harder to predict. Investigating outliers or anomalous data within that fold could provide valuable insights for model improvement.

### **Feature Importance (Coefficients):**

| Feature           | Coefficient | Interpretation                               |
|-------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------|
| R&D Spend         | **38,102.27** | Significant positive impact on profit        |
| Marketing Spend   | **3,543.39**  | Moderate positive impact                    |
| Administration    | **-1,841.48** | Slight negative impact on profit             |
| State_California  | **-315.26**   | Minimal negative impact on profit            |
| State_Florida     | **623.53**    | Slight positive impact on profit             |
| State_New York    | **-308.27**   | Minimal negative impact on profit            |

- **`R&D Spend`** remains the strongest predictor by a large margin.
- **OneHotEncoded `State` feature** shows minor influences with small coefficients:
  - `State_Florida` slightly positive, while `State_California` and `State_New York` are slightly negative.
  - The coefficients are relatively small compared to numeric features, indicating that geographic location (`State`) does not significantly influence the predictions in this particular dataset.

## **Comparison to Model Without OneHotEncoder:**

| Aspect                           | Without OneHotEncoder | With OneHotEncoder |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|
| Test RMSE                        | 8,995.91              | 9,055.96 *(Slightly worse)* |
| Cross-validation RMSE (Average)  | 9,546.94              | 10,361.65 *(Slightly worse)* |
| Strongest Predictor              | R&D Spend             | R&D Spend          |
| State Feature impact             | N/A                   | Minimal Impact (small coefficients) |
| Complexity                       | Simpler model         | Slightly more complex, minimal gain |

- Inclusion of the `State` categorical attribute does **not significantly improve** prediction accuracy (RMSE near identical).
- The categorical feature `State` has minimal impact, adding only minor complexity to the model.
- Both models strongly rely on the same primary predictor (`R&D Spend`).

---

### **Conclusion & Recommendation:**
- Given the near-identical performance, including the `State` attribute via `OneHotEncoder` doesn't provide significant predictive benefits.
- It's practical to prefer the simpler model (without `OneHotEncoder`) for easier interpretation and implementation, unless there's a specific business interest in differentiating profits by location explicitly.

---

### **Recommended Next Steps:**
- Investigate high-error predictions to identify potential outliers or missing influential features.
- If needed, evaluate alternative regression models (Ridge, Lasso, or Random Forest) to potentially improve stability and accuracy.
