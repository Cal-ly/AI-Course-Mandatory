## **Analysis of Linear Regression without OneHotEncoder**

### **Dataset Information:**
- **Total dataset:** 50 instances
- **Training/Test Split:** 40 training instances, 10 test instances.

### **Sample Predictions:**

| Predicted Profit | Actual Profit | Percentage Error |
|------------------|---------------|------------------|
| 126,703.03       | 134,307.35    | 5.66%            |
| 84,894.75        | 81,005.76     | 4.80%            |
| 98,893.42        | 99,937.59     | 1.04%            |
| 46,357.71        | 64,926.08     | 28.38%           *(High deviation)*|
| 129,128.40       | 125,370.37    | 3.00%            |

- **Average Percentage Error:** 8.58%
- **Sample RMSE:** ~9,247.92 (indicating moderate prediction accuracy).

### **Overall Model Performance (Test Set):**
- **Final Test RMSE:** 8,995.91
  - This value indicates that the predictions are, on average, around $8,996 away from actual profits, suggesting a reasonably reliable model performance for financial predictions.

---

### **Cross-validation Performance:**
- **CV RMSE Scores:** [7,741.03, 9,127.21, 8,217.65, 7,741.03, 14,741.44]  
  Shows a good consistency except for one fold significantly higher (~14,741.44), suggesting potential outliers or variance in some data subsets.
- **Average CV RMSE:** 9,546.94  
  Close to the test RMSE, which suggests good overall stability and generalization ability.
- **CV RMSE standard deviation:** 2,688.86 (Indicates variability due to a few challenging data points).

---

### **Feature Importance (Coefficients):**
- **`R&D Spend`: 38,014.74**  
  Very strong positive predictor, indicating high impact on profit.
- **`Marketing Spend`: 3,543.39**  
  Moderately positive, meaning higher marketing expenses tend to moderately increase profits.
- **`Administration`: -1,841.48**  
  Slightly negative, suggesting administration expenses do not strongly benefit profit, and higher administrative costs may slightly lower profit.

---

### **Conclusion & Recommendations:**
- The linear regression model generally performs well on your data, showing strong predictive capability, particularly driven by `R&D Spend`.
- The presence of outliers or data anomalies (indicated by the large error in one fold) could merit further investigation.
- Administration's small negative impact suggests it's not critical, and possibly could be dropped to simplify the model further.

Overall, the model performs well for this small dataset, is clearly interpretable, and aligns effectively with your business goals.
